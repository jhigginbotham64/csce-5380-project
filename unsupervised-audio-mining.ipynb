    "### Running the Code\n",

    "Once Julia has installed Jupyter, you can run Julia notebooks by invoking Jupyter from within your Julia installation. The following script does this, adding the `--no-browser` flag and backgrounding the process.\n",

    "# runs miniconda jupyter notebook on default port.\n",

    "# runs on the same port as your SSH tunnel. also,\n",
    "# if you're not able to connect then make sure you\n",
    "# get the right URL token from stdout.\n",
    "~/.julia/conda/3/bin/jupyter notebook --no-browser &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--no-browser` flag is helpful if you want to run Jupyter remotely and connect to it from the web browser on your local workstation. The comments in `run.sh` mention SSH tunnels, because I have found them to be the easiest way to get things running and connected. This requires creating an SSH tunnel to the same Linux server you are running Jupyter on, as the same user you want to run Jupyter as, before invoking `run.sh`. Once that's done, you should be able to connect to your remote Jupyter process in your local web browser using whatever localhost port you chose when creating the tunnel (I've been using 8888, Jupyter's default port). See [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/remote-jupyter-notebook/) for more help with Jupyter and SSH tunnels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you finally connect to Jupyter, navigate to wherever you saved this notebook and click on it to open it (it should be called `unsupervised-audio-mining.ipynb` by default). From that point on it's just a Jupyter notebook running Julia, so refer to the [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/) (Julia backend for Jupyter) documentation for further assistance."
